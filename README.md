# HuffmanFileCompression
Lossless file compression/decompression using Huffman trees

To use it, run compress.py

Compressing the file yields a new file with an extension .huf

Decompressing a .huf file yields a file with an extension .huf.orig

To get the original file from the decompressed version, simply remove this extension
